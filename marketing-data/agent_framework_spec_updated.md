# Agent Framework Spec (Updated with Calvin, the CRM Agent)

## Overview
Each agent follows a consistent front-end content guide, with five rows:
1. **Introduction** – personalized intro with variable substitution
2. **Impact Statement** – why this problem matters
3. **Insights + Visualization** – two-column row (left = insights, right = chart, with optional metadata below)
4. **How We Solve** – concrete, personalized actions or outputs (e.g., blog titles, CRM strategies)
5. **ROI / Conclusion** – high-level value proposition or profitability framing
